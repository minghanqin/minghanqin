# About Me :)

I earned my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) <img src='./img/thu.png' style='width: 2em;'>, where I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Haoqian Wang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/whq_en/main.htm) and collaborated closely with [Prof. Yebin Liu](https://www.liuyebin.com/) on 3DV & Human Avatar Reconstruction. Prior to this, I completed my B.Eng. in Measurement and Control Technology & Instruments at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) <img src='./img/seu.png' style='width: 2em;'>. During my graduate studies, I also had the privilege of visiting [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) <img src='./img/seas.png' style='width: 1.2em;'> as a research intern, working with [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people/hanspeter-pfister) on computer graphics.

I am currently an Researcher at ByteDance Seed <img src='./img/bytedance.png' style='width: 6em;'>, focusing on cutting-edge challenges in <b>perception, generation, and world model</b>.
